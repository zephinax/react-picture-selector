description: Learn about the main capabilities of React Picture Selector and how to install it in your project.
---

React Picture Selector provides a complete solution for handling image uploads with a modern and responsive interface. It supports both drag-and-drop and traditional selection methods, offering real-time progress indication through a smooth progress ring or percentage display. Animations are optimized with `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring fluid transitions and minimal CPU consumption even on lower-end devices. Upload operations can be safely canceled using the built-in `AbortController`, providing users with full control over the process.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (Next.js 15 and React 19 ready)
- **React 18 or 19** with concurrent rendering enabled
- Your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, bun, or yarn)
- Optional but recommended: TypeScript for strong typings on props and `apiConfig`

<Callout type="info" title="TypeScript support">
The package ships with TypeScript declarations so you get prop IntelliSense out of the box.

## Peer dependencies

| Package | Version | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `react` | `^18 || ^19` | Core rendering primitives |
| `react-dom` | `^18 || ^19` | DOM renderer used by Next.js/CRA |
| `axios` | `^1` | HTTP client leveraged for upload/delete requests |

You can install everything at once:

```bash
npm install react-picture-selector react react-dom axios
```

<Callout type="info" title="Required dependencies">
If your project already depends on React 18+ and Axios, you only need to install `react-picture-selector`.
</Callout>

## Project setup checklist

1. **Install the package** using the matrix above (and ensure peer deps are in place).
2. **Import the component** wherever you handle profile or gallery images.
3. **Pass `imageUrl` and `onChangeImage`** so the component stays controlled.
4. **Choose an integration mode**:
   - Provide `apiConfig` for real API calls, or
   - Enable `testMode` for mocked uploads during development.
5. **Style it** by adjusting `size`, `type`, `colors`, or `additionalClassNames`.

Once those steps are complete, the selector is production-ready.

## Basic Setup

```jsx
import PictureSelector from "react-picture-selector";
import { useState } from "react";

function ProfilePage() {
  const [currentImage, setCurrentImage] = useState("https://example.com/avatar.jpg");

  const handleImageChange = (imageUrl: string, responseData?: any) => {
    setCurrentImage(imageUrl);
    console.log("API Response:", responseData);
  };

  return (
    <PictureSelector
      imageUrl={currentImage}
      onChangeImage={handleImageChange}
      type="profile"
      title="Profile Photo"
      size={150}
    />
  );
}
```
<Callout type="success" title="Ready to Use"> Your React Picture Selector is now installed and ready! Continue to the next section to explore advanced configuration options. </Callout>

## Verify your setup

1. Run your dev server (`npm run dev`) and open the page containing `PictureSelector`.
2. Click or drag an image to trigger the upload flow. In test mode, you should see the progress ring animate to 100%.
3. Switch `testMode` off and provide an `apiConfig` to confirm real network requests succeed.
4. Trigger deletions to ensure your backend receives the correct HTTP method and body.

<Callout type="warning" title="Common gotchas">
- Always return a URL in your upload response at the path specified by `responsePath`.
- When using Next.js app router, keep the component on the client (e.g., `use client`) because it relies on browser APIs.
- If your API relies on cookies/sessions, set `withCredentials` to `true` and configure CORS to allow credentialed requests.
