The `PictureSelector` component is a highly customizable React component designed for seamless image upload, deletion, and preview functionality, ideal for profile pictures or general image management. Use it when you want to ship a polished upload experience without rebuilding drag & drop, preview modals, or API wiring from scratch.

## Features

- **Smooth Image Upload**: Upload images with a progress ring (for profiles) or percentage display, powered by `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations and low CPU usage.
- **Flexible Image Deletion**: Delete images via API with customizable HTTP methods, headers, and request body, or simulated deletion in test mode.
- **Progress Indicator**: Displays a progress ring for circular profiles or a percentage-based indicator, with non-linear fallback for servers without `Content-Length`.
- **Drag and Drop Support**: Allows users to drag and drop images with visual feedback, with prevention of dragging selected photos for better UX.
- **Image Preview**: Clickable modal preview for uploaded images, supporting circular and rectangular formats.
- **Full API Response Access**: Provides the full API response body as an optional parameter in `onChangeImage` for advanced use cases.
- **Configurable Styling**: Customize colors, sizes, shapes, and additional CSS classes for full control over appearance.
- **Abort Controller**: Cancel ongoing uploads using `AbortController` for better user control.
- **Event Callbacks**: Support for `onUploadSuccess`, `onUploadError`, `onDeleteStart`, and `onDeleteSuccess` callbacks to handle upload and deletion events.
- **Test Mode**: Simulate uploads and deletions with configurable delays, ideal for testing without API dependencies.
- **Debug Logging**: Toggle verbose upload/delete lifecycle logs with a `debug` prop.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports RTL layouts, responsive sizing, and both circular (profile) and rectangular image types.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Displays clear error messages for failed operations, with proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Prevents race conditions, ensures clean percentage displays, and optimizes resource usage using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

## Core Concepts

### Upload experience

- **Drop zone and picker**: Users can drag files onto the selector or open the OS picker. When an upload is running, the drop zone is visually disabled to prevent duplicate requests.
- **Abortable progress**: Uploads use `AbortController`, so canceling, deleting, or navigating away halts the request and resets progress cleanly.
- **Accessible previews**: The preview modal is keyboard navigable, traps focus, and adapts to both circular (“profile”) and rectangular image modes.

### Test mode vs real mode

- **Test mode** simulates uploads and deletions locally. It is perfect for Storybook, design reviews, or rapid prototyping without a backend.
- **Real mode** sends HTTP requests described in `apiConfig`. You receive the resulting URL and the raw API response via `onChangeImage` so nothing is lost.

<Callout type="info" title="State management">
`PictureSelector` is stateless; you control the `imageUrl` prop. Update your local or server state when `onChangeImage` fires to keep the UI in sync.
</Callout>

## Props overview

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `imageUrl` | `string` | ✅ | Current image shown in the selector or placeholder if empty |
| `title` | `string` | ✅ | Title rendered above the selector (and announced for accessibility) |
| `type` | `"profile" \| "image"` | ✅ | Controls layout, aspect ratio, and progress indicator style |
| `size` | `number` | ✅ | Base dimension in pixels for the component |
| `onChangeImage` | `(url: string, response?: unknown) => void` | ✅ | Fires after upload/delete so you can persist state |
| `apiConfig` | `ApiConfig` | ❌ | Enables real upload/delete requests with headers and callbacks |
| `testMode` | `boolean` | ❌ | Forces simulated uploads with configurable delays |
| `colors` | `ColorPalette` | ❌ | Overrides primary/error/progress/placeholder/text colors |
| `additionalClassNames` | `SelectorClassNames` | ❌ | Granular class overrides for title, buttons, or image shell |
| `showProgressRing` | `boolean` | ❌ | Toggles the radial indicator for profile images |
| `blurOnProgress` | `boolean` | ❌ | Blurs the current photo while uploads run to hint a change |
| `debug` | `boolean` | ❌ | Logs upload/delete lifecycle details to the console (redacts auth headers) |

## Testing scenarios

| Scenario | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Designing UI states | Enable `testMode`, adjust delays, and preview empty vs filled selectors |
| Integrating with a backend | Start in test mode to wire callbacks, then add `apiConfig` and monitor network traffic |
| Handling errors | Force a rejection in test mode or point to a known failing endpoint to confirm the error UI |
| RTL layouts | Wrap the component in `<div dir="rtl">` to verify spacing, focus, and animation direction |
